	 * Goal: To find Fibonacci Series for a given range

	 * 
	 * Shortcuts: 1) Print : type: syso, followed by: ctrl + space + enter 2) To
	 * create a 'for' loop: type 'for', followed by ctrl + space + down arrow +
	 * enter
	 * 
	 * What are my learnings from this code? 
	 1) How codes execute line by line  
	 2) How Assignment operator performs
	 3) How values changes by executing the code line by line
